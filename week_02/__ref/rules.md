# IDM 6660 Week 2 Assignment
## Due Sunday, January 29th at 11:59 P.M. Central Time

### Submission

Once you have finished your code, please push a commit to your repo with the following title:
`Week 2 Assignment - FINAL`.

### Here are the rules for this assignment:

1. Remember that this assignment depends upon you completing your second check-in this week. Before you start work on this assignment, make sure you have the work files in your week_02 folder. If the merge worked, they will be there.
2. Using the screenshots in the ref/screenshots folder, you need to style the included HTML document to match the screenshots. There are 4 designs, spread across 3 media queries, and you should try to do them all.
3. You **MAY NOT** change the HTML or the image files in any way. The only file you may edit is the CSS file.
4. I have included the CSS code that I developed for the first design, (the mobile-first, 0 to 480px design). Study that code and try to figure out what it is doing before you dive in.
5. This will probably be a very challenging assignment for most of you. I'm not expecting you to do it perfectly, but try to get as close as you possibly can. Next week, I will share the code that I used to create the screenshots.

### Hints

1. Watch the video I am including below.
2. Look at the file names for the screenshots if you're stuck on the media queries and their widths.
3. Work small to big. It will be a lot easier for you if you do one design, then move on to the next biggest one.
4. Use your web inspector! You can get a lot of good information about where in your CSS you are laying down rules that are causing you problems.
5. The text gets larger in the first 2 queries
