Changes based upon feedback:

-Removed "home" link from main navigation bar. It will be the first link in the
 (future) menu.
-made Kramarczuck's logo bigger and more graphic in placement. Changed the
scale of the header logo and navigation bar for better readiblity.
-Added a footer
-Added contact info/address to the footer
-lots of comments/feedback about the images, the fact that the text is in the
images, not in the html. Comments about how the images fit together (or don't
at all) and the sizing/spacing.
I removed most of the images with text in them. I decided to feature one main
image below the navigation bar to streamline the site visually. Each page of
the site (accessible through the menu in the future) will have just one image
in the same place, just below the navigation bar. This will ease the visual
clutter that all the different sized/shaped images with text were making.
-added more written copy to home page; an origin story.

In the code:

-fixed inconsistent indentation. Could you recommend where to find the info for 
what is correct indentation, spacing, etc...?
-changed id's to classes
-Changed <br>s to <p>s. Too bad about the <br>s, they were handy.
-using more of the semantic HTML5 tags like Header, Section, Main, Article,
etc...
-Bigger menu/navigation bar

Feedback not acted upon:

-Make a menu. I haven't yet figured out how to make the menu.
-Social media links: haven't yet figured out how to make the social media icons.
-call link with phone icon: haven't yet figured it out. is it the "i" element?

Notes:

One thing really would like to figure out how to do is to make the
header/navigation and the footer go from edge to edge (take up the whole screen
width), but have the content in between the header and footer be narrower. From
day one I tried to figure this out, and burned many hours on it. I didn't ask
for help because I was changing my over all structure a lot from day to day,
so I thought the solution would change depending on my structure.
Thought I'd figure it out sooner or later, but I haven't.
