  <li>
    <h2>Brazil</h2>
    <p>Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is
      produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state of Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.</p>

      bean. The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region.</p>

    <h2>India</h2>
    <p>Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as âIndian monsooned coffee". Its flavor is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor characteristics of Pacific coffees, but at its worst bland and uninspiringâ. The two well known species of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta. Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast Asia is S.795.</p>
