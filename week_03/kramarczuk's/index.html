        quality coffees and teas. Sure, we want you to have a great cup of coffee and a great

        your caffeine standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, did we mention <em>caffeine</em>? We've just started funding the guys doing all
        the wonderful research at the <a href="http://buzz.headfirstlabs.com"
        title="Read all about caffeine on the Buzz">Caffeine Buzz</a>.
        If you want the latest on coffee and other caffeine products,
        stop by and pay them a visit.

      <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
      <p>
        "A man, a plan, a coffee bean". Okay, that doesn't make a palindrome, but it resulted
        in a damn good cup of coffee.  Starbuzz's CEO is that man, and you already know his
        plan: a Starbuzz on every corner.
      </p>
      <p>In only a few years he's executed that plan and today
        you can enjoy Starbuzz just about anywhere.  And, of course, the big news this year
        is that Starbuzz teamed up with Head First readers to create Starbuzz's Web presence,
        which is growing rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs of a whole new set of
        customers.
